# Gen AI Data Query Dashboard

## Introduction  
Welcome to the **Gen AI Data Query Dashboard**.  
This project is a **React-based dashboard prototype** that allows users to **input natural language queries** and get **instant data visualizations**.  
The goal is to **simplify data analysis** for non-technical teams, eliminating their dependency on data engineers.  

## Features  
- **Natural Language Query Input** – Users can type queries in plain English.  
- **AI-Powered Suggestions** – Smart suggestions to help users refine queries.  
- **Query History** – Stores recent queries for quick access.  
- **Result Visualization** – Data is displayed using interactive charts.  
- **Loading & Error States** – Handles different query scenarios gracefully.  

## Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Redux.
- **State Management:** Redux  
- **Charting Library:** Chart.js
- **Deployment:** Vercel 

## Installation & Setup  

### Create App
```bash
npx create-react-app data-query-dashboard
cd data-query-dashboard
```
### Install Dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```
### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm start
```

## How It Works?  
1. **User enters a natural language query** in the input box.  
2. **The system simulates query processing** (mock AI response).  
3. **Results are displayed as an interactive chart.**  
4. **The query is stored in history** for future use.

## Learnings & Challenges  
- **Implemented Redux** for global state management.  
- **Integrated Chart.js** for data visualization.  
- **Ensured responsive & clean UI** using CSS.  
- **Simulated an AI query response system** without a backend.

## Final Thoughts  
This project was a great learning experience in **state management, UI development, and data visualization**.  
Looking forward to improving it further!
